* The name of the project I am presenting today is 'ascii-art-color'.
I was the team captain, and my team members were Jack and Luis.

This application converts printable ASCII symbols - such as numbers, letters, parentheses, special characters... - 
into (ascii art) images, and applies colour to the images.

* The application has three distinct inputs:

1) The terminal command which includes a string, and a flag that specifies the colour and the position of letters to be coloured. 
2) A text file that contains (ascii art) images.
3) A map of colours and their corresponding escape codes and colour code notations (e.g. RGB) to be used in the print formula.

* These inputs are combined as follows:

The algorithm makes a map where the keys are the decimal numbers corresponding to ascii symbols, and the map values are the images' lines.
The print formula applies the escape code and RGB notations to the map values corresponding to each letter in the string provided.

* Team cooperation:

Each member of the team had independently researched the project, hence we were able to choose amongst different solutions.
For example Jack contributed the draft colour notation syntax, while Luis provided the blueprint algorithm used to colour distinct letters. I added additional features, for instance have strengthened the colour notation by adding the colour orange which was previously missing, further have changed the algorithm so that it could colour non-adjoining letters. Additionally I ensured that the code could perform in a variety of scenarios, including missing or bad user inputs.

* The next step for this project could be making a web site gui with the same functionality.
